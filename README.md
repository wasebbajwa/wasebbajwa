### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Waseb Bajwa, and I'm a recent graduate of the MSDS program at Northwestern. This repository contains some of my past projects and projects I'm currently working on. I also sometimes takes notes in Jupyter Notebooks, so I've tried my best to attach some of the notes to repos as well!
